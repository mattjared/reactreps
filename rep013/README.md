# React Router 4.0 Trial

To make your own react router 4.0 trial you have to npm install react router for it to work. I missed the boat on the one and spent a few minutes tinkering around until it hit me what was required for app.js to work. If you make your own version of this with create-react-app just run the following...

```
create-react-app yourApp
cd yourApp
npm install --save react-router@next
npm start
```

That's all. Happy routing and reacting!
