# Get your (react) reps in.
The best way to learn something new is to practice it. The best way to learn a new web technology is to do 100 variations of the piece of technology you want to learn. For React I want to make 100 React apps to learn and grow my skills.

To open an app or tinker on one...

`cd` into whichever rep you'd like and run `npm start`. You'll get a dev server up and running, make changes in app.css or app.js and you're on your way.

Possible reps I'd like to attempt:
- [x] [timer, kinda](https://github.com/mattjared/reactreps/tree/master/rep001)
- [x] [change a class on click](https://github.com/mattjared/reactreps/tree/master/rep005)
