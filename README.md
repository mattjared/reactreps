# Get your (react) reps in.
The best way to learn something new is to practice it. The best way to learn a new web technology is to do 100 variations of the piece of technology you want to learn. For React I want to make 100 React apps to learn and grow my skills.

To open an app or tinker on one...

`cd` into whichever rep you'd like and run `npm start`. You'll get a dev server up and running, make changes in app.css or app.js and you're on your way.

Possible reps I'd like to attempt:
- [x] [change a class on click](https://github.com/mattjared/reactreps/tree/master/rep005)
- [ ] show cursor location
- [ ] some kind of weather output reading an API
- [ ] to do list
- [ ] personal site generator
- [ ] bookDB
- [ ] tax bracket breakdown
- [ ] cost of living breakdown
- [ ] budget builder
- [ ] timer
- [ ] navigation menu
- [ ] tabbed nav
- [ ] add state to every pixel hovered over
- [ ] html minifier
- [ ] time on site calculator
- [ ] show time in your city and in other cities
- [ ] figure out how to deploy to a production site
- [ ] turn any birthday into a color
- [ ] turn any name into a color
- [ ] pig latin translator
- [ ] resume maker (enter a bunch of data and click a few buttons to change styles made)
- [ ] swanson pyramid of greatness
- [ ] markdown editor
- [ ] calculator
- [ ] "are there nba games today?" app
- [ ] sticky scroll bar
- [ ] usefull css output with a gui like [this](http://www.lugolabs.com/caret)
